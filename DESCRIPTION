        Model for Identification of Driver Chromosomal Imbalances in

Description: This package enables the detection of driver chromosomal
        imbalances including loss of heterozygosity (LOH) from array
        comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data. VegaMC performs
        a joint segmentation of a dataset and uses a statistical
        framework to distinguish between driver and passenger mutation.
        VegaMC has been implemented so that it can be immediately
        integrated with the output produced by PennCNV tool. In
        addition, VegaMC produces in output two web pages that allows a
        rapid navigation between both the detected regions and the
        altered genes. In the web page that summarizes the altered
        genes, the link to the respective Ensembl gene web page is
        reported.
